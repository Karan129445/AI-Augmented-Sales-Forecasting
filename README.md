# AI-Augmented Sales Performance & Forecasting Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 2017 sales data to understand why strong revenue did not fully translate into profitability.  
The analysis focuses on identifying profit leakage, evaluating the impact of discounting, and forecasting short-term sales to support business decision-making.

The project combines **Python-based analysis**, **H2O AutoML forecasting**, and **Power BI dashboards** to deliver actionable business insights.

## Business Problem
- Sales growth in 2017 did not consistently convert into profit  
- Heavy discounting raised concerns around margin erosion  
- Decision-makers lacked clarity on:
  - Which products were losing money
  - How discounts impacted profitability
- Short-term forecasting was required for planning and control  

---

## Key Insights
- Discount-related losses accounted for a significant portion of total profit  
- Profit losses were concentrated in specific sub-categories (e.g., Tables, Machines)  
- Medium and high discounts increased sales volume but reduced overall profitability  
- Revenue growth toward year-end did not translate into proportional profit growth

## Forecasting Approach
- Built a **3-month sales forecast** using H2O AutoML  
- Forecast focused on **directional trends**, not exact point prediction  
- Results used to support inventory planning and pricing decisions  
- Raw forecast outputs were transformed in Power BI for business-friendly date representation.

## Business Recommendations
- Restrict medium and high discounts on loss-making sub-categories  
- Redesign pricing strategy for structurally unprofitable products  
- Use forecast insights for inventory and demand planning  
- Track profit margin alongside revenue as a core KPI
